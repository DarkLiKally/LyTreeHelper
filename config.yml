# LyTreeHelper's configuration file
#
# About editing this file:
# - DO NOT USE TABS. You MUST use spaces or Bukkit will complain. If
#   you use an editor like Notepad++ (recommended for Windows users), you
#   must configure it to "replace tabs with spaces." In Notepad++, this can
#   be changed in Settings > Preferences > Language Menu.
# - Don't get rid of the indents. They are indented so some entries are
#   in categories.
# - Lines starting with # are comments and so they are ignored.
